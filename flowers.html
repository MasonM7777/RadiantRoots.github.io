                        <p>Leontopodium nivale, commonly called edelweiss is a mountain 
                            flower belonging to the daisy or sunflower family Asteraceae. The plant 
                            prefers rocky limestone places at about 1,800– 3,400 metres (5,900–11,200 ft)
                            altitude. It is a non-toxic plant. Its leaves and flowers are covered with 
                            dense hairs, which appear to protect the plant from cold, aridity, and 
                            ultraviolet radiation. It is a scarce, short-lived flower found in remote 
                            mountain areas and has been used as a symbol for alpinism, for rugged beauty 
                            and purity associated with the Alps and Carpathians. It is a national symbol of 
                            several countries, specifically Bulgari, Austria, Slovenia, 
                            Switzerland, and Italy. In Romania it was declared a "monument of nature" in 
                            1931. The Edelweiss day is celebrated on 5 March. According to folk tradition, 
                            giving this flower to a loved one is a promise of dedication. </p>

                        <p>Very close by, in the S'Albufera Natural Park, is the Prat orchid or palustris,
                             which belongs to the group of endangered flowers classified as Vulnerable. Its 
                             purple inflorescences, which grow in the form of a bouquet, give off a sweet aroma 
                             that attracts insects such as bees and butterflies, thus facilitating pollination 
                             and maintaining the balance between the animal and plant kingdoms.</p>
